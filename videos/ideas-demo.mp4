# Deploy Give me ideas Demo Video — Step-by-Step

## Overview
Add the trimmed ideas-demo.mp4 (29s, 3.2MB) to the "Give me ideas" feature card on parentflare.com, matching the phone mockup frame pattern used by Plan my time.

---

## Step 1: Upload the video file to staging branch

Go to: **https://github.com/shilligoss/parentflare-website/new/staging/videos**

- **File name:** `ideas-demo.mp4`
- Click "uploading an existing file" link at the top
- Drag/drop or select the `ideas-demo.mp4` file I gave you
- Commit message: `Add Give me ideas demo video`
- Make sure you're committing to the **staging** branch
- Click "Commit changes"

> If the `staging` branch doesn't exist yet, create it first:
> Go to https://github.com/shilligoss/parentflare-website → click the branch dropdown → type `staging` → click "Create branch: staging from main"

---

## Step 2: Edit index.html on staging branch

Go to: **https://github.com/shilligoss/parentflare-website/edit/staging/index.html**

### Find this block (the "Give me ideas" feature card):

```html
        <div class="feature-card card-ideas fade-up">
          <div class="feature-icon">&#127919;</div>
          <h3>85+ activities &mdash; or we'll make you one</h3>
          <p>Choose a curated activity filtered by age, time, and prep level &mdash; or describe your moment and we'll build a custom one on the spot. Every activity comes with steps, a script for what to say, and a "why it works" explanation.</p>
        </div>
```

### Replace with:

```html
        <div class="feature-card card-ideas fade-up">
          <div class="feature-icon">&#127919;</div>
          <h3>85+ activities &mdash; or we'll make you one</h3>
          <p>Choose a curated activity filtered by age, time, and prep level &mdash; or describe your moment and we'll build a custom one on the spot. Every activity comes with steps, a script for what to say, and a "why it works" explanation.</p>
          <div class="phone-mockup-frame" style="margin-top:24px;">
            <video autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" style="width:100%;border-radius:12px;display:block;">
              <source src="/videos/ideas-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
          </div>
        </div>
```

- Commit message: `Add Give me ideas demo video to feature card`
- Commit to **staging** branch

---

## Step 3: Verify on preview

Vercel will auto-deploy the staging branch to a preview URL. Find it at:
- https://vercel.com/dashboard → parentflare-website project → Deployments tab
- Or check the GitHub commit for the deployment link

**Check:**
- Video plays automatically, muted, looped
- Video is inside a phone-frame style container
- Doesn't break the layout on mobile
- Plan my time video still works too

---

## Step 4: Merge to production

Go to: **https://github.com/shilligoss/parentflare-website/compare/main...staging**

- Click "Create pull request"
- Title: `Add Give me ideas demo video`
- Click "Merge pull request"
- Click "Confirm merge"

Production (parentflare.com) updates automatically.

---

## Optional: Delete the old `public/videos/` folder

Per your TODO list, if there's still a `public/videos/` folder in the repo from the old location, delete it. The videos now live at the root `/videos/` path.

Go to: **https://github.com/shilligoss/parentflare-website/tree/main/public/videos**
- If that folder exists, delete any files in it
